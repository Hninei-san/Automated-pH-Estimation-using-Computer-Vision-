Automated pH Estimation using Computer Vision  for Water Quality Assessment

To develop a computer vision system capable of estimating the pH level of water samples by analyzing color changes on test strips
1. Automation: Traditional pH measurement methods require manual observation and interpretation. By using computer vision, we automate the process, reducing the need for manual intervention.
2. Visualization: Provide users with a clear understanding of the pH distribution within the sample, facilitating further analysis.
3. Accessibility:  Make pH estimation more accessible to a wider range of users. Only with the captured images, users can easily implement and utilize the system for pH analysis
